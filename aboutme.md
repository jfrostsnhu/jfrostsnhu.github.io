# Hey there!

 My name is James. I am an undergraduate in my senior year at Southern New Hampshire University. I have worked in just about every 
 industry prior to settling in technology and I've been working in this field for over 16 years. Two things I love most about technology 
 is the challenge in resolving complex issues and the opportunity to learn new things each day. 

## Fun facts about me:

- I live 10 minutes from the beach
- I fly airplanes for a fun
- I am a car enthusiast
